## Description
The Library Management System is a Java Eclipse project designed and developed by Habiba Abdelaziz. It serves as a comprehensive solution for managing library items and user accounts efficiently. The system provides functionalities such as adding library items, user authentication, borrowing and returning items, user account management, and generating various reports. This README provides an overview of the project, its key features, and how to use it.

## Main Functionalities
The Library Management System encompasses the following core functionalities:
1. **Login Validation:** The program validates user login credentials against a stored file of authorized users. Successful authentication grants access to the system.
2. **Library Item Management:** Librarians can perform actions like adding new library items, updating item information, checking item availability, and handling borrowing and returning of items.
3. **User Account Management:** Librarians can manage user accounts, including creating new accounts, updating account information, and specifying if a user is a librarian or a regular user.
4. **Reports Generation:** The system provides the functionality to generate reports based on various criteria, such as borrowing history, inventory status, or user information.

## Included Features
The project incorporates several programming concepts and technologies, including:
- **Polymorphism:** Achieved by treating different types of library items as a common `LibraryItem` class, enabling code reusability and flexibility.
- **Inheritance:** Utilized to create a class hierarchy, with `LibraryItem` as the base class and specific item types (e.g., Book, AudioBook, CD) inheriting from it to reduce code duplication.
- **File I/O:** Employed for data storage and retrieval, including user credentials, library items, and other relevant information, ensuring data persistence.
- **Threads:** Used to handle concurrent tasks, ensuring efficient operation in multi-user environments.
- **Serialization:** Enabled the storage and retrieval of objects in a serialized format, facilitating data persistence and object sharing.

## Technologies Used
- Java Swing
- Eclipse IDE
